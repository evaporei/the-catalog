## motivation

Consider this to be written from the point of view of a priviledged one that lives in a huge metropolis in a third World country.

It came to be after two years of living alone in the infamous COVID-19 pandemic, after **a lot** of self-reflection, study and therapy.

This catalog starts primarely with Eva's (see [#about](#about) section) point of view of the world. It's public and free, as in freedom, so that other people can read, contribute _[5]_ (TBD) and share subjects they've studied and found interesting/relevant for other people (following a guideline of course).

## disclaimer

Those who write **the-catalog** have NO requirement to be experts in the field they're writing about. It should be clear that the "community" of the "Modern Comprehensive Designers" just gathers a group of people that seek to share knowledge and views of the world.

## about

The author of it is named **Eva Pace** (**they/she**), a Brazilian software engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo. It started as a hobbie in April 2022 after learning the fascinating story of the **Whole Earth Catalog**, in the book **From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism** by **Fred Turner**.

## notes

1. "Comprehensive Designer" is a term that is used in the "From Counterculture" book that **roughly** refers to the community around the "Whole Earth Catalog", someone that has and seeks cross field knowledge;
2. TBD: To Be Decided;
3. Philosophy is used here as of set of principles of any kind, it does NOT have to do with the **Philosophy field**;
4. The quotes here intend to give the sense of: we'll talk about discipline but it isn't something we necessarily believe in;
5. This catalog is and will always be public and free, but for the early stages it will only written by Eva Pace. Once the project has a clearer shape and proper contributing guidelines, it will be open for others to write and contribute as well ðŸ˜Š.
